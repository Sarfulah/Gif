# Gif

The app will take the topics in this array and create buttons in the HTML.

The app will append a button for each string in the array.


When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, it will display its rating (PG, G, so on).

There's a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. It then makes a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
